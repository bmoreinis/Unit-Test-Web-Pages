    <h1>How To Do This Quiz</h1>
    <p>These instructions are in index.html AND in <a href="instructions.html">instructions.html</a>. When you press Run, it only shows you index.html - so you have to keep track of what you are putting into index.html and where it came from. Also - these instructions have examples of all the code you need to do this test!</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>There are <b>6 pages</b> with problems:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="1sections.html">1sections.html</a></li>
      <li><a href="2formatting.html">2formatting.html</a></li>
      <li><a href="3resources.html">3resources.html</a></li>
      <li><a href="4lists.html">4lists.html</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each page has an image of what either the code or the page (when you click Run) should look like.  For example, the code for <a href="1sections.html">1sections.html</a> should look like this:</p>
    <img src="hello.jpg" border=1><br>

    <h2>What to do</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Set up index.html</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Get the problem code</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Go to the next page you are working on (like <a href="1sections.html">1sections.html</a>)</li>
            <li>Get the code: 
              <ol>
                <li>Click inside the code</li>
                <li>Press Control+A to select all</li>
                <li>Press Control+C to copy it</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Paste it into index.html</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Click inside <a href="index.html">index.html</a></li>
              <li>Press Control+A to select all</li>
              <li>Press Control+V to paste it</li>
              </ol>
            </ol>
          </li>
      <li><h3>Fix Code</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Look at the top of the page for an HTML comment. It tells you which image the page should look like and what to do.</li>
          <li>Press Run to see what the page looks like now.</li>
          <li>Fix the code on the page.  There may be indentation problems (if the instructions say) as well as code problems.</li>
          <li>Press Run when you think it is done, and see if it matches the picture of what it is supposed to look like.</li>
        </ol> 
      </li>
      <li><h3>Paste from index.html to original</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>When the code looks good and the image matches, press Control+A to select all of the code, then Control+C to copy it.</li>
          <li>Go back to the original page (like 1hello.html) and press Control+A to select all, then Control+V to paste the new code on top.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Next Page</h3>
        <p>Go to the next page to work on (like 2survey.html). To read these instructions again. get them from instructions.html (because you removed them from index.html) and paste them onto index.html.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Completing This Quiz</h2>
    <p>Keep pasting the HTML over index.html, reworking it, and then pasting it back where it belongs.</p>
    <p>When done, submit the link to your work to the Web Unit Test assignment in Classroom. The link should begin with <b><i>https://replit.com/@</i></b>.</p>
